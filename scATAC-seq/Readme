**Module5: scATACseq module**

The single cell ATAC-seq module accepts input in 10X CellRanger-atac format that comprises of :

1. Peak/Cell matrix (filtered_peak_bc_matrix.h5): This is analogous to the gene expression count matrix used to analyze single-cell RNA-seq. However, instead of genes, each row of the matrix represents a region of the genome (a peak), that is predicted to represent a region of open chromatin. Each value in the matrix represents the number of Tn5 integration sites for each single barcode (i.e. a cell) that map within each peak. 

2. Metadata

3. Fragments file: This represents a full list of all unique fragments across all single cells. This file contains all fragments associated with each single cell, as opposed to only fragments that map to peaks.
